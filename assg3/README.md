## Overview

This game is a university assignment for the Artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering course. It is a simulation of the popular [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game for two players. The main feature, however, is the implementation of the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm and it's extension, [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaâ€“beta_pruning), for the AI that the human player, or another AI, can play against.

The parameters of the AI player can be tweaked to set its difficulty. The game provides several different strategies with varying levels of difficulty, as well as their weights for additional flexibility.
